\section{Conclusion}
Convolutional Neural Networks is an technology who make us utilise object detection in an (almost) everyday basis. From smarter search engines, self driving cars, program detecting brain tumours and much more. The YOLO algorithm is one of those algorithm who is not the most accurate, but is one of the fastest, regarding the test computer has a state of the art GPU. YOLO comes as an open source project, making it easy for everyone to modify to suit their own projects. Testing reviled that the YOLOv3-tiny is very fast, but not that accurate, and there is slower alternatives, but still fast, like the YOLOv3-spp who are more accurate.
