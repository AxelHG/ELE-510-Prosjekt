\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Focus area}
This rapport is a project in the subject "ELE-510 Image Processing with Robot Vision". The original task were "Detection of one known object", like a dog. However this rapport will focus on recognition of objects using an artificial neural networks (ANN). This means that recognition of any form of object the neural network is trained to detect, will be tried to be detected. This mean optimally it will not only recognise one single object, but those object it is designed to recognise. 

\subsection{What is object recognition?}
Since the focus area of this rapport will be object recognition and not object detection, it is important to know the difference between those two terms.

\subsubsection*{Object detection}
Object detection, is detection one certain object given it is in the picture. For a program designed to detect numberplates, the input should be an image containing a numberplate. Then the output should be a bounding box around the numberplate, if it exist. Or it could be the position of the numberplate to be used later. One use for this type could be an automated toll station who need the numberplate of the veichels driving trough the toll station.
