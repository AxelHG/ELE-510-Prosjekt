\section*{Summary}
My task in this rapport were to cover one method of object detection or recognition, write some theory behind it and run some tests. I have chosen to write about the convolutional neural network algorithm You Only Look Once (YOLO) who is one of the fastest object recognition algorithms out in the open marked. It was a bit difficult to decide which algorithm to start with, but after some research, the YOLO algorithm stood out since it was quite fast, open source and therefor popular. 

YOLO were quite easy to get started with, but had some difficulties with making it work with Python since it is written in C.
